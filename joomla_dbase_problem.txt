Some problem with Joomla Data Base - db freeze when install joomla:

This problem occurring most usually at Joomla 3.x. and Joomla 2.5.xx To solve this go to: 

	xampp\htdocs\Your joomla folder\installation\sql\mysql 

and open Joomla.sql file find the term

	"ENGINE=InnoDB"

and replace ALL with

	"ENGINE=MyIsam"

MyIsam is more supported and compatible with Joomla.

Do also the same with (sample_data.sql) file, if it's quickstart setup.
