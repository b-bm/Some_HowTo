  sudo mount.cifs –> This is just the mount command, set to mount a CIFS (SMB) share

some info:

-> //Windows-PC/Share – This is the full path to the shared folder.

-> /home/geek/Desktop/Windows-Share – This is where we’d like the share to be mounted.

-> -o user=geek – This is the Windows username that we are using to access the shared folder.

Mount Windows Share from Linux ( Permanent, Available on re-boot).

By Performing this Section you will able to mount windows shared directory from Linux on Permanent Basis, Even if you re-boot then it will be available, But Of-Course Windows share must available.

First of all take backup of /etc/fstab file so if anything goes wrong you can always recover.

=>  To backup /etc/fstab file execute following command.

  root@tejasbarot-linux-ahmedabad:~ #cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.original

=> Open /etc/fstab with your Favourite text editor. I am using VIM as my editor.

  root@tejasbarot-linux-ahmedabad:~ # vim /etc/fstab

=> Now Insert Following entry

  //<windows-ip-address>/<share-name> /<local/mount/point> cifs username=username,password=password 0 0

For Example ( Entry Should look like below ) :-

  //192.168.1.3/share /mnt cifs username=tejasbarot,password=linuxahmedabad 0 0

Save and Exit from File. To save in VIM ( Press ESC and :wq and ENTER )

=> To Test Your Entry is correct or not Execute following command :-

  root@tejasbarot-linux-ahmedabad:~ # mount -a

No Error should be there once you execute this command.

=> Now You can Confirm by “df -h”

Този вар. е OK за мен !!!

Mount Windows Share from Linux ( Permanent, Available on re-boot).
By Performing this Section you will able to mount windows shared directory from Linux on Permanent Basis, Even if you re-boot then it will be available, But Of-Course Windows share must available.
First of all take backup of /etc/fstab file so if anything goes wrong you can always recover.

  To backup /etc/fstab file execute following command.

  root@xxxx:~ #cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.original

Mounting unprotected (guest) network folders:

Edit your /etc/fstab file (with root privileges) to add this line:

  //servername/sharename  /media/windowsshare  cifs  guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8  0  0
  //192.168.1.103/SharedDocs /home/schetovoditel/Downloads/WindowsShare cifs  guest,uid=1001,iocharset=utf8  0  0
  
Where

    -> guest indicates you don't need a password to access the share,

    -> uid=1000 makes the Linux user specified by the id the owner of the mounted share, allowing them to rename files,
    -> uid=1001 = schetovoditel
    -> iocharset=utf8 allows access to files with names in non-English languages. 
       This doesn't work with shares of devices like the Buffalo Tera Station, or Windows machines that export their shares using ISO8895-15.

    If there is any space in the server path, you need to replace it by \040, for example //servername/My\040Documents 

After you add the entry to /etc/fstab type:

  sudo mount -a

This will (re)mount all entries listed in /etc/fstab.
Now You can Confirm by “df -h” command
