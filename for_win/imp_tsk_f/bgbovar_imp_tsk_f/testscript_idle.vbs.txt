I use a script I title idle.vbs:

Dim objResult

Set objShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")    
i = 0

Do While i = 0
  objResult = objShell.sendkeys("{NUMLOCK}{NUMLOCK}")
  Wscript.Sleep (6000)
Loop

Every six seconds, this quickly toggles numlock on the keyboard.
This causing Windows to believe that someone is interacting with the keyboard and preventing screen lock. 
This runs on vanilla windows, you don't need development or scripting tools to use it. 
Just make a text file with .vbs as the extension and double-click it (or place it in your startup items).
